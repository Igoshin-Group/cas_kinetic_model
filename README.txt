This folder contains the code required for the data analysis and model
fitting described in the manuscript.

Note that hidden Markov model (HMM) fitting via ebFRET requires user input
and cannot be fully automated. Relevant ebFRET settings can be found in
the manuscript, and are reproduced here for convenience:
  Include settings here!!!
